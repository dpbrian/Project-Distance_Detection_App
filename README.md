# Project-Distance_Detection_App
Team: Brian Rojas - Derek Khanh - Lu Liu 


Group/Individual

-This project will be a group project between Brian Rojas, Quang Khanh, and Lu Liu. We will all share responsibility in the projects development. Each member in the party will document any research, code, bugs, outcomes, and the entire process of creating the product. 


Inception
What is the problem:

-Older model cars do not have a distance detection system that alerts them when they are getting too close to another vehicle. 
-Vehicles without some sort of distance detection are harder to park.
-Buying a car that has a system like that already installed, usually entails that the car will be expensive. 

Who are we making this for:
-We are making this for car owners without distance detection systems

-We are making this for people who would like an easier time parking in major cities with congested, tight parking. 

-We are making this for car and bike owners who would like a safety feature, preventing possible accidents and injury.
 
Why are we making this

-We are making this to provide a cheap alternative to distance detection for vehicles. This is a product that any college student, or any entry level driver can use to prevent accidents. We are also building this to enhance our software and hardware based engineering skills. This project requires knowledge in not only software programming, but hardware and sensor application.

What is our product
 
-Our product will be a raspberry pi based system with sensors to detect distance of objects in front of it. The entire product will be attached to the front of a vehicle and will interact with the user phone via bluetooth and any available method that communicates with the drivers phone to indicate how close the user is to coming in contact with another object. Code will run which will algorithmically determine how fast the users car is going with how close the object is approaching. Once a bottleneck is hit, the user will be signalled with a loud noise indicating future contact if the driver does not stop.


Main Features
	

-Safe - Raspberry pi hooked up with sensor that is able to detect distance and showcases measurements through a computer terminal. Once a certain distance is hit, an alarm will go off, indicating the user to stop the vehicle.

-Expected-To have all hardware connected to software, available on mobile devices and application does not interfere with other application. The app will be something that runs in the background, allowing the user to use GPS and other varias apps while commuting. 

-Reach-The entire hardware is solar powered with the application being a both GUI based and background based depending on the users interests. Communication features will be added, allowing other users to know (emergency services, family members) if there was a collision or a close call. 


Software Engineering Process
	
-We will being using a combination of the Waterfall and Agile Methodologies to accomplish our goals. We will meet often each week with addressing what has been accomplished and what set-back we are having. We will also conduct code reviews and maintain our ideal requirements to avoid scope creep and delays.



Version Control
	-We will be using Github as our version control system



Tools that will be needed.







TO DO: BEFORE PROGRAM STARTS, DISPLAY A DISCLAIMER TO THE USER STATING THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE THE DISTANCE OUTPUT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND NOT RELY ON IT. THE USER THEN HAS TO CLICK "I accept" AND THEN THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO ITS INTENDED FEATURE.
