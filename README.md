# Project-Distance_Detection_App
Team: Brian Rojas - Derek Khanh - Lu Liu 


Group/Individual

-This project was a group project between Brian Rojas, Quang Khanh, and Lu Liu. We all shared responsibility in the projects development. Each member in the party would document any research, code, bugs, outcomes, and the entire process of creating the product. 


Inception
What is the problem:

-Older model cars do not have a distance detection system that alerts them when they are getting too close to another vehicle. 
-Vehicles without some sort of distance detection are harder to park.
-Buying a car that has a system like that already installed, usually entails that the car will be expensive. 

Who did we make this for:
-We made this for car owners without distance detection systems

-We made this for people who would like an easier time parking in major cities with congested, tight parking. 

-We made this for car and bike owners who would like a safety feature, preventing possible accidents and injury.
 
Why we making this

-We made this to provide a cheap alternative to distance detection for vehicles. This is a product that any college student, or any entry level driver can use to prevent accidents. We also built this to enhance our software and hardware based engineering skills. This project requires knowledge in not only software programming, but hardware and sensor application.

What is our product
 
-Our product is a raspberry pi based system with sensors to detect distance of objects in front of it. The product can be attached to the front of a vehicle and interact with the users phone (currently only android) via bluetooth to indicate how close the user is to  another object. The algorithm determines how fast the users car is going with how close the object is approaching. If a minimum distance is not kept, the system will alert the driver.


Main Features
	

-Safe - Raspberry pi hooked up with sensor that is able to detect distance and showcases measurements through a computer terminal. Once a certain distance is hit, an alarm will go off, indicating the user to stop the vehicle.

-Expected-To have all hardware connected to software, available on mobile devices and application does not interfere with other application. The app will be something that runs in the background, allowing the user to use GPS and other varias apps while commuting. 

-Reach Goals-The entire hardware is solar powered with the application being a both GUI based and background based depending on the users interests. Communication features will be added, allowing other users to know (emergency services, family members) if there was a collision or a close call.
